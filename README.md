Course Project
=========

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


Notes
--------------
- You should download and unzip the package files (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) in the same directory where run_analysis.R is stored
- Only variables containing mean() and std() are considered

To run in R studio 
--------------


```sh
> source("run_analysis.R")
